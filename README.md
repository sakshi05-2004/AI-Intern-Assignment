# Quiz_Performance_Analysis

A Python-based project to analyze student quiz performance and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.

---

## Project Overview

This project helps students identify weak areas and performance trends based on quiz data. It provides personalized recommendations to improve preparation and visualizes performance through clear and informative plots.

### Key Features:
1. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Analyze quiz performance by topics and difficulty levels.
   - Identify weak areas, improvement trends, and performance gaps.
2. **Insights**:
   - Highlight weak topics and difficulty levels based on average accuracy.
   - Spot improvement trends over time.
3. **Recommendations**:
   - Suggest actionable steps for topics, difficulty levels, and question types.
   - Tailor suggestions to improve accuracy and confidence.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Graphical representation of scores and accuracy by topics.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/QuizPerformanceAnalysis.git
   cd QuizPerformanceAnalysis

###Usage Instructions
-Run the Python script:
       python main.py
-The console will display:
  --Insights on weak topics and difficulty levels.
  --Recommendations for improvement.
  --A visualization plot will be displayed with performance trends by topics.


# Approach
1. Data Loading:  Load JSON files containing quiz metadata, latest submission, and historical records.
2. Performance Analysis:  Analyze scores and accuracy for each topic and difficulty level.Calculate average accuracy for trends over time.
3. Insights Generation: Highlight weak topics and difficulty levels (accuracy < 70%).
Summarize trends and gaps.
4. Recommendations: Provide actionable steps for improvement.Suggest topics, difficulty levels, and question types to focus on.
5. Visualization: Create bar plots for average scores by topics.

Add line graphs for accuracy trends.
Example Output
Insights:
Weak Topics:
Structural Organisation in Animals: Accuracy 65.5%
Body Fluids and Circulation: Accuracy 68.2%
Weak Difficulty Levels:
Hard: Accuracy 58.7%
Recommendations:
"Focus on Structural Organisation in Animals. Revise key concepts and practice past questions."
